This gives us unduplicated musical variety.\n\nWe are centered around pop rock but fearlessly feature songs from any genre to hit the mainstream during our favorite decade, including hard rock, metal, rap, country, songs from hit movies, Broadway show tunes and more.\n\nBlackLight Radio: The 80s source of choice.",
